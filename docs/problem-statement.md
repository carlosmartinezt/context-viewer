# Problem Statement

## Who is this for?

Jenny — managing chess activities for the kids.

## The Problem

Managing kids' chess training involves juggling multiple moving pieces:

- **Tracking multiple players** — each child has their own coaches, schedules, skill levels, and goals
- **Coordinating with coaches** — lesson schedules, contact info, availability, and payment tracking
- **Tournament logistics** — registration deadlines, travel planning, accommodation, what to pack
- **Training progress** — what openings they're learning, tactics practice, curriculum from coaches
- **Scattered information** — details live in emails, texts, calendar apps, notes apps, and mental memory

The mental load comes from having to remember where information lives, keep it updated across places, and synthesize it when making decisions.

## Current Pain Points

_To refine with Jenny:_

- [ ] Forgetting upcoming tournament registration deadlines?
- [ ] Not knowing which coach is teaching what to whom?
- [ ] Difficulty tracking weekly practice schedules?
- [ ] Travel planning stress before tournaments?
- [ ] Losing track of kids' rating progress and goals?
- [ ] Other: _______________

## Desired Outcome

A single place where Jenny can:

1. **See at a glance** — who has what lesson, when is the next tournament, what's the weekly schedule
2. **Reduce mental overhead** — stop holding logistics in her head
3. **Stay organized** — without maintaining yet another system

## Why This Approach?

The app reads/writes to markdown files in Google Drive because:

- Jenny already uses these files (they're the source of truth)
- No new system to maintain — just a better view into existing data
- Works on her phone when she needs quick access

## Open Questions

_Things to validate with Jenny:_

- What's the #1 thing that causes stress today?
- How often would she realistically check this app?
- What's the minimum viable version that would actually help?
- Is the mobile-first approach right, or does she mostly manage this from a computer?

## Success Criteria

_How we'll know this is working:_

- [ ] Jenny actually uses it (weekly? daily?)
- [ ] Reduces time spent looking for information
- [ ] Fewer "oh no I forgot" moments
- [ ] _______________
